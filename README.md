# Sticky-Notes
An app used to generate sticky notes. Sometimes the best ideas come when least expected. Use a sticky to jot down those 'Eureka' moments.

Updates:
1. Added crumbled paper background
2. User can increase/decrease font size of sticky note

Future Upgrades:
Rather than have a set size for the 'larger/smaller' font buttons, I'd like to increase/decrease the size with each button click. There will be limits to how big or
how small the font gets, however.

Notes:
Added code to increase number of sticky notes. Currently not working as intended so I commented out that part of the code for now.
