# Sticky-Notes
An app used to generate sticky notes. Sometimes the best ideas come when least expected. Use a sticky to jot down those 'Eureka' moments.

Updates:
1. Added total of three background options. Background 2 is on by default. Users can click icons in top left corner to choose. Border appears around selected background
2. Removed ability to resize sticky note
3. Set limits on how large or small fonts can be. Maximum font size is 36px. Minimum font size is 12px.

Potential upgrades:
1. Options to change sticky note colors
3. Ability to retain content on sticky note if page is refreshed
4. Ability to drag and drop sticky note anywhere on the window
5. Create browser extension for use on any webpage
6. Option to delete sticky note

Notes:
Code to add a new sticky notes exists but has been commented out. Currently not working as intended.

Also, will eventually move CSS to external stylesheet
